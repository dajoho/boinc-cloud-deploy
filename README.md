# boinc-cloud-deploy
Automatically deploy BOINC projects to freshly-deployed cloud server instances

# What is this?
This script will run a deployment for cloud server instances to install, configure & setup a headless BOINC client.

It will download the client software, download an optional command line GUI for administrative tasks and also create an account on and attach to the BOINCStats Account Manager website for simpler system operation. It's not that this is particularly hard to do, but if you're lazy then it will certainly help.

# What this isn't
This isn't a container solution. I don't know shit about containers, although the premise sounds cool.

# How to use
Dead simple. Clone the repo, change directory, and run the script with sudo. Then follow the prompts.
